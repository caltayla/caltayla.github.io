  *<h1>welcome to dragonfly daycare</h1>*

  <main>
    <section class="intro">
      <p>Hi! Iâ€™m Cal â€” a warm, reliable, and passionate babysitter and domestic helper based locally. Iâ€™m 21 years old with over four years of hands-on babysitting experience, plus two years working at a local daycare. I care for children from newborns through to 13 years old, and I absolutely love what I do.</p>

      <p>My passion for childcare started at home, looking after my two younger brothers. They sparked my love for supporting childrenâ€™s growth and development â€” a passion I now back with formal study as I complete my Certificate IV in Special Needs Education Support at TAFE (due to finish in late 2025).</p>

      <p>I offer a wide range of services including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Babysitting (including overnights & weekends)</li>
        <li>House cleaning and tidying</li>
        <li>House sitting and pet sitting (with two yearsâ€™ dog-sitting experience)</li>
        <li>Running errands for busy families</li>
        <li>Fun excursions with the kids</li>
        <li>Arts and crafts (I always bring supplies when I can!)</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Certifications & Equipment:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Working With Children Check</li>
        <li>Police clearance</li>
        <li>Full First Aid certification</li>
        <li>Driverâ€™s licence and car seat</li>
        <li>Strong references available on request</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Rates:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Babysitting: $35/hr (or $40/hr for two families or more)</li>
        <li>Overnights: Rate for awake hours + 1 hour for house reset, then $70/night</li>
        <li>Cleaning/Tidying: $40/hr</li>
        <li>House sitting: $20/day</li>
        <li>Pet sitting: $50/day</li>
        <li>Errands: Based on distance</li>
      </ul>

      <p>If youâ€™re looking for someone genuine, dependable, and kid-approved â€” Iâ€™d love to hear from you.</p>

      <p>Warmly,<br><strong>Cal</strong></p>
